# Multi-Pendulum Simulator

This project is a web-based multi-pendulum simulator that allows users to visualize the motion of up to six pendulums. Users can adjust the length, mass, and angle of each pendulum, as well as global settings like gravity and damping. The simulator also includes an option to show trails of the pendulum bobs.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the Multi-Pendulum Simulator [here](https://pendulum-simulation.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Add and remove pendulums (up to six).
- Adjust the length, mass, and angle of each pendulum.
- Modify global settings for gravity and damping.
- Option to show trails of the pendulum bobs.
- Start and reset the simulation.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the simulator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the simulation logic and user interactions.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the simulator.

## Getting Started

To run the simulator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the "Add Pendulum" button to add pendulums to the simulation.
3. Adjust the length, mass, and angle of each pendulum using the input fields in the table.
4. Modify the global settings for gravity and damping in the "Global Settings" section.
5. Check the "Show Trails" checkbox to enable or disable trails for the pendulum bobs.
6. Click the "Start" button to start the simulation. Click it again to pause the simulation.
7. Click the "Reset" button to reset the simulation to the initial state.
